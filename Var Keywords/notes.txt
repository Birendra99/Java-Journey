Var keyword is a powerful addition that was introduced in Java 10. 
The var keyword allows you to declare a variable without explicitly specifying its type.
- You must explicitly initialize a variable declared with var.
-You cannot use var with lambda expressions or method parameters. for eg: var obj = (a, b) -> (a + b);
- It’s not allowed for method return types.
-Cannot use var for instance variables or global variables.
-It’s also not allowed as a generic type. Eg: var<var> list = new ArrayList<>();
