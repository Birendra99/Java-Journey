Insertion sort is sorting algorithm that place an unsorted element at its suitable place in each iteration.
It is suitable for the small data.
It is not suitable for the big data.
The time complexity of worst case and average case of Insertion Sort is O(n^2).
Best Case Time Complexity: O(n)
Advantages:
Simple Implementation
Efficient For Small Data.
Adaptative.
