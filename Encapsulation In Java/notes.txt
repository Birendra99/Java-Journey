Encapsulation means hiding the data from the users and cannot give direct access to the users.
But we can access the data with the help of setter and getter methods.
It involves bundling related data (variables) and methods together within a single unit, which we call a class.
Key Points:
1) Data Hiding:
- It allows us to hide the implementation details of a class from outside access.
- We achieve the Encapsulation by declaring the instance variables(fields) of a class as a private.
-Public Interface
Benefits:
-Cleaner Code
-Data Security
- Controlled access
-Java Bean Examples.
