In Java, access modifiers determine the visibility or scope of various elements within the code. They control who can access classes, interfaces, fields, constructors, and methods.
There are four types of access modifiers in java:
i) Public (can be accessed from everywhere if it is Public.)
ii) Private (Only used inside the class of own.)
iii)Protected(In case of Protected we can used in different package and subclasses but cannot in different package with the non subclasses).

iv)Default (We cannot used default in different package and subclasses.)(Can be used in same package and non subclasses.)
