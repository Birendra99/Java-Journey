-Data Abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essentials information to the user.
-It can be achieved with either abstract classess or interfaces.

-Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details of a program while exposing only the essential API required for using that implementation.
-It simplifies the interaction with a system by presenting a clean and simplified interface to the user, concealing the underlying complexity.

Real-Life Example:
-Consider a television remote control. It provides a straightforward interface with buttons and symbols, allowing users to perform actions like changing channels or adjusting volume.
-Users donâ€™t need to understand the intricate technical details of how the TV functions; they interact with the remote control in an abstract manner.


-In Java, abstraction is achieved through interfaces and abstract classes.
-Interfaces allow us to achieve 100% abstraction by defining method signatures without implementation details.
-Abstract classes are declared using the abstract keyword and can have both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods.
-An abstract class may or may not have all abstract methods.
-Abstract methods must be redefined (overridden) in subclasses, making overriding compulsory or even making the subclass itself abstract.
